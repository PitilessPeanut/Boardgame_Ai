#### Decision Making AI

This is a new, custom, hand-written implementation of a **Zero-Knowledge Reinforcement Learning** algorithm that, unlike AlphaZero, does NOT suffer from the [shallow trap](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/04/27) problem and should be able to play *solved* games perfectly.

While focusing on General Game Playing, aka. *Effective Decision Making under Uncertain or Incomplete Information* (EDMUII), this project aims to implement [Artificial General Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) in a easy-to-use and quick-to-depoly way that is also usable. Since this is the most difficult[^1] problem in the universe, far surpassing quantum physics, elliptic curve arithmetic and axionic singularity modulation, it remains an ongoing research project! Please be considerate ðŸ”¬
 

### Building

1. Include `includeai.hpp` 
2. Inspect the examples (in the `example` folder) on how to use
3. Profit...
