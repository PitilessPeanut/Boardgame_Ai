### Decision Making AI

This is a new, custom, hand-written implementation of a **Zero-Knowledge Reinforcement Learning** algorithm that, unlike AlphaZero, does NOT suffer from the [shallow trap](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/04/27) problem and  should be able to play *solved* games perfectly.

General game playing, aka. *Effective Decision Making under Uncertain or Incomplete Information* (EDMUII), is the most difficult[^1^](#a1) problem in the universe, far surpassing quantum physics, elliptic curve arithmetic and axionic singularity modulation. As such, this is still an ongoing research project! ðŸ”¬ Please be considerate
